Changes
=======
The interpreter currently runs in RAM from $1000. However, it *is* designed to be ROMable.

At present obviously much is not implemented ! There is an "Alpha plan" in TODO.txt which gives
some idea what does and doesn't work at any given stage. Anything "Alpha 2" stuff listed under
Alpha 2 should work.

Some things may never be, but they will be things that largely don't matter. Some things will 
depend on how the new kernel works. It may operate differently.

Line editing is due to appear relatively late on (Alpha 6 at the time of writing). 

Initially the BASIC is designed to use Low RAM ($0000-$9EFF) as storage, though this is not
fixed in stone. Options such as placing variables in $A000-$BFFF will likely appear.

1) At present the default is integer. The final naming scheme will have optional variable 
types % # and $ , with the option to set the default.

2) REM statements now require comments to be in quotes. DATA statements will require text 
elements to be in quotes as well. REM "This is a comment". 

3) Lines cannot be longer than 251 tokens, which doesn't really matter as you can't put more than 
80 characters in a line anyway because of the screen editor.

4) Spacing is not stored but may be required. You can't write FORT=1TO10 any more. (You shouldn't
anyway). It will actually parse it as [FORT] [=] [1] [TO10]

5) There are currently only 26 integer variables A-Z. These are and will be permanent (though if
the default type is floats then the will be 26 floating point variables).

6) Floats are down the end of the list of things to implement but the hooks are already in there.

7) IF <test> GOTO <line> does not work and won't. You can still do IF .. THEN GOTO or IF ... THEN <line>
This is to allow multiple line IFs (the 'THEN' is used to indicate this is a single line IF)

8) RND() is reserved for floats for compatibility so a function RANDOM() exists which generates a 16 
bit random number.

9) DOKE and DEEK are 16 bit versions of POKE and PEEK.
